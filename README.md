# Artificial Intelligence

Repository with exercise codes for Artificial Intelligence.
The Jupyter Notebook is from Stanford and can be found [here](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html#algorithm "Algorithms").

The other ones are the ones I used in my AI classes. They are mostly in Portuguese, but I'm working on the English translations for them.  
Enjoy!
